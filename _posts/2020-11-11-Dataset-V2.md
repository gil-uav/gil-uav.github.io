The results from training a U-net on dataset v0.0.1 were better than feared.
I thought there would be too much noise and bad iterations from the dataset, as mentioned in the
previous [post]({% post_url 2020-11-09-Dataset-V1 %}). Despite the discussed issues, the network handled the dataset surprisingly well:

## Training metrics:

![**F1 score from validation**](/img/val_f1.svg)

![**Loss from validation**](/img/val_loss.svg)

## Predictions:

![**Orthophotos with predicted buildings from the test set.**](/img/resultsv001.png)

![**Ground truth with predictions from the test set.**](/img/resultsv001_2.png)

As can be seen on set number two on the figures above, another issue with the dataset occurred.
When extracting sets, some of the raster maps were extracted out of bounds from the aerial imagery
base. This resulted in some black parts of the maps. Another observation is that several sets
contain images with the background class only. An important part of the network is distinguishing between buildings and water and what is not.
However, these sets might only prolong the training time, as many pixels belonging to the background class exists in the sets containing the
target classes. This also translates to sets containing only water. I believe that there are enough
sets with both target classes than for these sets to be included.

## Bumping the dataset to v0.1.0
Regarding what i just mentioned, the new dataset has no sets with images that contain black pixels(0,0,0) as these are out of bounds sets and might induce noise.
Sets containing only background class or only water class have also been removed. This resulted in reducing the dataset from **25,1Gb** to **17,8Gb**, and from **67219** to **43802** samples. 
There are still improvements to be made on the variance of the dataset and the annotations' accuracy. Said improvements are the goal for the next version.
